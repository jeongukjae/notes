- Why Graphs?
  - effective data structure to describe and analyze entities with relations.
- How to we take advantages of the graph for better prediction?
  - Explicitly modeling relationships
- Modern ML systems are designed for simple sequences and grids
  - but graphs have...
    - arbitrary size and complex topological structure
    - no fixed ordering
- We can develop neural net that are much more broadly applicable by modeling Graphs
- Representation learning will be the main topic for this course
  - automatically learn the features without tuning the features each time
- ML tasks related to graphs: node classification, link prediction, graph classification, clustering, ...
- choice of the proper network representation of a given domain/problem determines our ability to use netowrk successfully
  - the way we assign links will determine the nature of the question we can study.
  - directed or undirected
  - bipartite graph
  - edge list, adjacency matrix or adjecency list
  - node and edge attributes
  - weighted edges, self edges, multigraphs, ..
