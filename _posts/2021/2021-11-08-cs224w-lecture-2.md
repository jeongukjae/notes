- This lecture
  - In traditional graph ml pipeline, features for nodes, link, and graphs are manullay desinged. (hand-designed features)
  - topic of this lecture: traditional features for ..
    - node level preiction
    - link level prediction
    - graph level prediction
  - for simplicity, we focus on undirected graphs
- Node level tasks
  - features
    - node degress
      - the number of edges the node has
      - nothing special, but very useful feature
    - node centrality
      - node degree counts the neighboring nodes without capturing importance.
      - different ways to model importance
        - eigenvector centrality
        - betweenness centrality
        - closeness centrality
        - and many others...
    - clustering coefficient
      - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient>
    - graphlets
      - clustering coefficient counts the # triangles in the ego-networks
      - => so we can generalize it by counting # pre-specificed subgraphs
      - graphlet degree vector (GDV): graphlet-base features for nodes
        - degree counts # edges that a node touches
        - clustering coefficient counts # triangles that a node touches
        - GDV counts # graphlets that a node touches

      - graphlet degress vector provides a measure of a node's local network topology
- Link level tasks
  - link level prediction task: the key is to design features for a pair of nodes
  - link level features:
    - distance based feature => shortest path distance between two nodes.
      - this does not capture the degree of neighborhood overlap
    - local neighborhood overlap
      - captures # neighboring nodes shared between two nodes
      - but this is always zero if the two nodes don't have any neighbors in common
    - global neighborhood overlap
      - katz index: count the number of paths of all lengths between a given pair of nodes -> via powers of the graph adjacency matrix

- Graph level tasks
  - kernel method
    - idea: design kernels instead of feature vectors
    - kernel $$K(G, G')$$ measures similarity between data
    - there exists a feature representation $$\phi$$ such that $$K(G, G') = \phi(G)^T\phi(G')$$
  - graph kernel
    - key idea: bag of words for a graph
    - below kernels use Bag-of-* representation of graph
    - graphlet kernel
      - count the number of different graphlets in a graph
      - we can normalize graphlet kernel features if graphs to compare have different sizes.
      - but graphlet kernel is expensive operation.
    - Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel
      - idea: use neighborhood structure to iteratively enrich node vocabulary
      - generalized version of bag of node degress since node degrees are one-hop neighborhood info.
      - color refinement: algorithm for Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel
      - after calculating color refinement, WL kernel counts number of nodes with a given color
      - this method is computationally efficient
  - other kernels
    - random walk
    - shortest path graph kernel
    - ..
